# Two-Wheel Self-Balancing Robot

This repository contains the **final Mechatronics project** for the Fall 1403 semester at the University of Tehran.  
The project focuses on the design, modeling, and implementation of a **two-wheel self-balancing robot**, integrating mechanical, electrical, and control engineering concepts.

---

## Project Objectives
- Design and build a robot that balances itself on two wheels using **DC motors** and sensors.
- Implement control algorithms (PID) to maintain stability when disturbed.
- Ensure the robot can return to upright position after tilting.
- Allow external commands for movement (remote/mobile input).

## Tasks Completed

### Theoretical Section
- **System Block Diagram Analysis**  
- **Circuit Analysis**: design of filters, sensor measurement circuits, simulation in Proteus  
- **Mechanical Analysis**: structure, motors, battery placement  
- **Simulation in MATLAB**: dynamic modeling and controller design  
- **CAD Design in SolidWorks**: 3D modeling of robot parts, placement of electronics  
- **Motion Analysis in SolidWorks Motion**  
- **System Modeling & Identification**  
- **Algorithm Design & Calibration**  
- **Preparation of Bill of Materials (BOM)**  
- **Android mobile app for PID parameter adjustment and movement commands**  
- **Balancing while carrying a payload (e.g., a cup filled halfway with water)**  
- **System simulation in Simscape**
- **PCB design in Altium** 

### Practical Section
- Fabrication of the robot based on CAD design  
- Assembly of motors, sensors, electronics, and battery  
- Implementation of PID controller in microcontroller (e.g., Arduino + HC-06 Bluetooth)  
- Testing and tuning of balancing performance  
- Evaluation based on speed, accuracy, cost, appearance, and innovation
